# note-taker

## Description

With this project, I wanted to create a useful service for someone struggling to remember appointments, calls, or other important things throughout the day. This simple website allows a user to add, delete, and view notes that they've written, and it will save that data so the user can return later to find it still persists. It uses a database to keep track of notes they've written. The functionality that this web app showcases inludes GET, POST, and DELETE requests through Express.js to keep track of data that the user wants to add, view, or remove.
